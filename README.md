# Resume-Django_project

The first Django project I developed was a comprehensive personal profile website. It showcased details about myself including my biography, skills, contact information, and offered services. To enhance the visual appeal, I utilized HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, integrating Bootstrap classes for better styling and layout. The profile section provided an overview of my background and achievements, while the skills section highlighted my expertise in various areas. Additionally, a contact section allowed visitors to reach out via email or phone. The services section outlined the professional offerings I provided. This project served as an excellent introduction to Django development while also showcasing my abilities and professional offerings in an aesthetically pleasing manner.
